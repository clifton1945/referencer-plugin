h1. Referencer Plugin

Source code of the intellij IDEA "Referencer plugin":http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin?pr=&pluginId=7104
This is a plugin for the various intellij IDEs, working in IDEA, PhpStorm, AppCode, etc.



h2. Description

The plugin helps to quickly copy/insert references of different types.

When evoking the referencer plugin, a list of selectable references, taken automatically from the
current context, is opened. The references can be inserted or copied.

The references are useful to save time otherwise needed for looking up and having to type informations
that are actually present somewhere else already.
Possible use cases are for example: annotating debug outputs, copying the namespaced classname of the
currently edited javascript file (w/o having to locate it in the currently edited file!) for doing tests
in the browser console, and many more (see feature list).



h2. Keyboard Shortcut

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C twice to open the references list for copying references to the clipboard,
Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+V twice to open the references list for inserting references into the editor.

The list can be cancelled via Esc key, navigated using cursor keys and items are selected using Enter.



h2. Types of references

All parsed items in the following list are relative to the current caret position,
for example "previous classname" refers to the first classname found when searching backwards starting
from the caret position. Some references are only specifically available for certain file types.

* Current date/time formatted as YYYY-MM-DD and YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
* Current UNIX timestamp in seconds and milliseconds

* Path to current file
* Current filename
* Current filename::line number
* Path to current file::line number
* When having a multi-line selection: File path / selection: line num. sel. start - line num. sel. end
* When having opened more than one file: list of paths to all opened files

* PHP files: previous classname::previous method name
* PHP files: previous classname::line number
* PHP files: previous classname
* PHP files: previous function name
* PHP files: previous/next variable name

* JavaScript files: namespace.classname
* JavaScript files: namespace.classname.previous method name
* JavaScript files: namespace.classname::line number
* JavaScript files: previous/next method name
* JavaScript files: file path formatted as namespace

* References of all endings to occurences (in current file) of the word at the caret
